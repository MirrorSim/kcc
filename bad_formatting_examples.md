Here are some formatting issues I've observed in some Kindle Store manga:

1) faded black levels causing unneccessarily low contrast, which is hard to see and can cause eyestrain.

This is comparing the Kindle Store version of 
Fire Force Vol. 1 on a Kindle Scribe 
against the Humble Bundle version on a Hisense A9.
Both devices are using Eink Carta 1200 panels.

The Kindle Scribe is completely capable of showing correct black levels,
demonstrated here with the Humble Bundle version:

Incorrect black levels causes manga to look faded and washed out, and is a lot harder to see and can cause eyestrain.
The effect is even more pronounced on eink vs LCD since it's already lower contrast.

2) Unneccesary margins, usually at the bottom

Manga should be fullscreen, since most Kindles are much smaller than physical paper volumes.
I've even seen cases where margins are added on all 4 sides, not just the bottom.

3) Incorrect page turn direction for right to left manga.

4) 2 page spread alignment off by 1

Sometimes there's a single page misaligned in landscape:

which throws off the alignment off all further pages. The spine should have whitespace in the center, not on the edge.:
